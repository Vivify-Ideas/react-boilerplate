## Start

After cloning the repo to run the application in development mode you should execute:

```sh
$ yarn && yarn dev
```

## Building for Production

```sh
$ yarn build
```

By default `production` mode is used during the build process if the argument `--mode staging` isn't passed.

Make sure that `.env.{mode}` file is available during the build with required env variables.
